# Knapsack
This contains an asymptotically optimal solution to the whole item Knapsack problem. This uses a DP approach.
The input will start with an positive integer, giving the number of instances that follow. For each
instance, there will two nonnegative integers, representing the number of items and the capacity, followed
by a list describing the items. For each item, there will be two nonnegative integers, representing the
weight and value, respectively
